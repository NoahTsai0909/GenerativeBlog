Video games are addicting, but they're not addictive enough to make you want to stop playing them.

That's the conclusion of a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which looked at the effects of video game addiction on the brain. The researchers found that playing video games for more than an hour a day can lead to long-term changes in brain structure and function that are similar to those seen in people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. In fact, the study's lead author, neuroscientist David Nutt of Imperial College London, told the BBC that "video games have the potential to be as addictive as alcohol or tobacco" and that they should be treated as such.


The study, which was funded by the UK's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brains of 12 healthy volunteers while they played a variety of computer games, including first-person shooter (FPS) games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, and action-adventure games like The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Participants were then asked to fill out a questionnaire about their gaming habits, as well as to complete a battery of neuropsychological tests to measure their brain activity and mood. They also took part in an fMRI scan that measured the blood flow in their brains while the participants were playing the games. This allowed the researchers to determine the extent to which the players' brains were responding to the game's visual and auditory cues, while also measuring the amount of time they spent playing each game.
